**Designing Your Voice:** _Synthetic Sounds from Circuits_ blends three discrete disciplines with an emphasis in this order:

- Sound Design
- Embedded Audio Programming
- Eurorack Hardware Development

We explore sound synthesis on Teensy microcontrollers and ultimately craft eurorack hardware to create a patchable synthesizer. All three of these subject matters are fundamental to the class, however sound design lies as the foundation while audio programming and hardware development serve as tools for exploring it.

# Designing Your Voice

Designing Your Voice: Synthetic Sounds from Circuits is a class blending three discreet disciplines:

- Sound Design
- Embedded Audio Programming
- Eurorack Hardware Development

Over the Course of 14 weeks we will be exploring sound synthesis on Teensy microcontrollers and ultimately crafting eurorack hardware to create a patchable synthesizer.

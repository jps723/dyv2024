# Designing Your Voice

**Designing Your Voice:** _Synthetic Sounds from Circuits_ is a class blending three discreet disciplines, in this order:

- Sound Design
- Embedded Audio Programming
- Eurorack Hardware Development

Over the Course of 14 weeks we will be exploring sound synthesis on Teensy microcontrollers and ultimately crafting eurorack hardware to create a patchable synthesizer. All three of these subject matters are fundamental to the class however sound design lies as the foundation while audio programming and hardware development serve as tools for exploring it.

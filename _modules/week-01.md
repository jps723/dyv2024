**Get:**

- Obtain a Teensy 4.0 or Teensy 4.1 (only one of them), and an audio shield. There are some available in the shop to checkout for short term use however we will need them on an ongoing basis. See the [Teensy Hardware & Setup](https://designingyourvoice.com/TeensyHardware/) page for my recommended hardware setup for this class.

**Write:**

- Write a blog post introducing yourself in relation to sound/music and email me a link to it before class 2. Feel free to discuss your personal tastes/aesthetics that you’re drawn to. Everyone will present for 3-5 mins in Week 2. In later weeks, not everyone will present.

**Optional Prompts:**

- Describe your favorite and least favorite sounds. What do they sound like and how do they make you feel? Imagine that you are describing them to someone who hasn’t heard them before and be as descriptive as possible. Feel free to include audio/video references.

- Choose 1-2 artists who have inspired you and show their work as references, describing why it is exciting to you. They do not need to incorporate electronic sounds into their music.

- Talk about interesting sounds from your daily life. What memories or feelings do you associate with these sounds?

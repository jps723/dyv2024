### Homework:

Homework this week is in two parts. I encourage you to collaborate and work alongside each other but each person will present individually next class. You can present on one topic or both, but document both on your blog. 

1) Patch in VCV Rack/Cardinal: Alter my patches or start from scratch. Try to test your understanding of the things we've talked about (or haven't talked about...you can also just experiment).  The goal of this is to get more comfortable with modular patching. Don't overthink it. Experiment, experiment, experiment. No rules, just patch :). 

2) Brainstorm and Dream Big: This is a continuation of our activity from the end of last class. Further consider the second half of the semester and the type(s) of module(s) that you want to build. Do you want to make a synthesis module that outputs audio or do you want to make a modulation source? Or a gate/trigger source? How can you incorporate body movement, data, or an external program (p5?) to trigger or otherwise affect other synth modules? How might you be able to incorporate ideas or projects from other classes? Don't worry about feasibility so much right now. We can get there.

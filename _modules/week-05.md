### Homework:

**Watch:**

Make:

Incorporate some of the musical concepts that we've discussed into your sketch(es). I'd encourage you to collaborate either in your groups from last week, or a different group, or otherwise on your own. Document your work in a blogpost.

Optional prompts:

1. The cMajor scale examples we looked at built off of a 4 voice FM example that I had elaborated on from weeks 2 and 3. Incorporate the same musical elements into an example of your own where you can manually control a filter, or envelope parameters. Add more buttons/knobs as needed. If you were to have 12 buttons, you could create a full octave, and then with a single knob to adjust the octaves, you'd be able to play any traditional song!

2. Add more scales. In class we looked at a major scale, however all scales are formulaic in nature. Look up the formula(s) for other scales and create an array, or series of arrays that incorporates more scales so that your synth has a bigger arsenal of musical possibilities!

3. Make an arpeggiator. This week we spoke about chords, which is the playing of select notes from a scale simultaneously with one another. A common tool in electronic music is an arpeggiator, which instead plays the same notes that are in a chord, but in succession - In traditional music this is known as an arpeggio. This teensy arpeggiator reference might be helpful - there are several videos in the series. Create an arpeggiator so that:

   a) each button press plays the first, then the third, and then the fifth note of a major triad chord.

   b) Remove the buttons altogether and incorporate time into your sketch so that an arpeggio is constantly being stepped through. Perhaps incorporate a knob to adjust the overall speed of the arpeggio, or the length of the arpeggio (playing 3 notes from the scale (triad) or 4 (adding "the 7th"), or 5 (adding "the 9th").

   c) Something else? ðŸ¤”

Make: Work with a partner to build off of your previous sketches.  Experiment with rearranging your signal path. How does that change the resulting voice? Document your work using a blog post.

Optional Prompt: Try to make your code more module so that it can be spread across two teenies. Consider creating a more complex oscillator mixer for one module that will then feed into your partners module (or vice versa) using the line level inputs/outputs. 

Start to think about your previous sketches and ways you might elaborate on them for a midterm project. This does not need to be a full fledged instrument. The purpose of this project is to take what you've learnd and design a signal path that allows for an expressive sound. More complexity will come.

Make: Work with a partner to build off of your previous sketches.  Experiment with rearranging your signal path(s). How does that change the resulting voice? Document your work using a blog post.

Optional Prompt: "Modularize" your code, so that it can be spread across two teenies. Consider creating: 

Person A: a more complex oscillator with different waveforms and tunings. How can you elaborate on  

Person B: use the line level inputs (i2s1) on the teensy audio board to take in the signal from Person A's teensy, and process it on yours. Maybe consider making something that begins with an ADSR envelope. If you're currently using a button, how can you begin to think about generating more interesting rhythms? Code? Different sensors? 

Start to think about your previous sketches and ways you might elaborate on them for a midterm project. This does not need to be a full fledged instrument. The purpose of this project is to take what you've learnd and design a signal path that allows for an expressive sound. More complexity will come as we begin to chain together our ideas!

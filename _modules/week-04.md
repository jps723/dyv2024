Make: Build off of your sketch from last week to incorporate an effect, or series of effects. Explore the ones that we didnâ€™t look at in class; Experiment with changing the order that you connect them. How does that change the resulting voice? Document your work using a blog post. Sketch out ideas for your midterm (and/or final) project. What are you hoping to achieve and how will it help to extend your musical self expression?

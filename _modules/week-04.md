Make: Build off of your sketch from last week to incorporate an effect, or series of effects. Explore the library; Experiment with rearranging your signal path. How does that change the resulting voice? Document your work using a blog post.

Start to think about your previous sketches and ways you might elaborate on them for a midterm project. This does not need to be a full fledged instrument. The purpose of this project is to take what you've learnd and design a signal path that allows for an expressive sound. More complexity will come.

Continue with your work from last week and look to the alternate prompts that you haven't yet explored. I'll re-share them below (and I added one for the DAC). Work with, and talk to each other, even if you're not collaborating as partners. Write a blog post. It will help you! 

Hone in on what you are trying to explore and how you want others to interpret/experience it. Is it a practical instrument that you're designing for others, or is it instead an avenue for your artistic expression where you want to share your quirks and nuances? 

Choose from the following prompts from last week, with an updated option for external DACs. Work independently or in a group. 

a) Breadboard with the DAC that I provided in class and play with one of your previous sketches without using the audio shield.  

b) Use the Teensy examples from class to model a particular sound/set of sounds. e.g. Try to make a four piece drum kit (Kick drum, snare, hi-hat, and ______ ). Many of the overarching characteristics will come from the envelope. Look at my noise envelope examples for ideas. How can you describe specific sounds using the parameters of their envelope? What beginning oscillator(s) are used for achieving these sounds? If you're having trouble thinking it through, try to do it in VCV first. Some googling may help conceptually, as well. 

c) Research existing synthesizers/eurorack modules that have the same/similar function(s) that you'd like your final project to include. i.e. If you want to make a sequencer, find a sequencer module and describe its features. How does it work, and what would you need to implement to replicate it with a teensy? What inputs/outputs does it have and what signals go to/from them? Start prototyping. If you're exploring some sort of data/sensor inputs that don't exist in the synth context yet, what will be your challenges?

d) Look at the String object in the Teensy library. Along with implementing it (it's similar to use as other oscillators, and there is a built in example) research "Karplus Strong". Does it conceptually make sense to you how this sound is achieved? What other sounds are you compelled to try to model yourself?

# Online Resources

[Teensy Website](https://www.pjrc.com) - The official Teensy website with active forum, products, tutorials, etc. The forum is particularly helpful.

[Modwiggler](https://www.modwiggler.com/forum/index.php) - A popular forum for all things modular synths.

# Hardware

General advice: quality parts will save you time and money in the long run. If you can prevent it, your tools should not be a source of frustration!

[Pre-formed jumper wires](https://www.amazon.com/Elenco-Piece-Pre-formed-Jumper-Wire/dp/B0002H7AIG/) - These are a lot less flimsy than others I have used. Keeping a neat breadboard will make prototyping/troubleshooting much more streamlined.

[Test Leads](https://www.amazon.com/Goupchn-Silicone-Multimeter-Minigrabber-Electronic/dp/B0852KRNPP/) - Very useful for probing your circuits

[Oscilloscope](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Oscilloscope-Portable-Sampling-Oscilloscopes/dp/B0BXD6JL8T/) - The shop has several digital oscilloscopes. You do not need one for this class, however they can be very helpful when troubleshooting.

# Online Resources

[Teensy Forum](https://forum.pjrc.com/index.php) - The official Teensy forum. Very strong and helpful community.

[Modwiggler](https://www.modwiggler.com/forum/index.php) - A popular forum for all things modular synths, including DIY.

# Hardware

Relatively cheap tools that have served me well for prototyping. This list will grow as we advance through the semester.

[Pre-formed jumper wires](https://www.amazon.com/Elenco-Piece-Pre-formed-Jumper-Wire/dp/B0002H7AIG/) - These are a lot less flimsy than others I have used.

[Test Leads](https://www.amazon.com/Goupchn-Silicone-Multimeter-Minigrabber-Electronic/dp/B0852KRNPP/) - Sometimes alligator clips are too bulky. These are great.

[Digital Oscilloscope](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Oscilloscope-Portable-Sampling-Oscilloscopes/dp/B0BXD6JL8T/) - Very helpful for troubleshooting audio circuit oddities.

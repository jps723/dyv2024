# Weekly Presentations

Each week a different person will be assigned an audio development platform, synthesizer format, microcontroller project, etc. that we will **NOT** work with in this class, to research and present on for 5-7 minutes at the beginning of each session. Slideshows, reference videos, and/or demos are all acceptable. Each student will present once throughout the semester

There are LOTS of options out there for sound synthesis. This series is intended to give us all (myself included!) a wider exposure to the tools that exist in this space.
